I have reviewed the contract and mapped out fund-loss vectors, focusing on share accounting, external calls, and token behavior.

### Critical Vulnerabilities

1) Unsafe ERC20 interactions (no return-value checks)
- What: The contract calls `transfer` and `transferFrom` directly and assumes success. Many non-standard ERC20s return `false` instead of reverting. Your state changes happen before the token call in `deposit`, so a failed token transfer can leave inflated `userShares` without funds received.

- Attack scenario:
  - Attacker uses a token that always returns `false` on `transferFrom`.
  - Calls `deposit(amount)`. State mints shares to attacker based on `amount` or the share formula, but no funds are actually transferred.
  - Attacker then calls `withdraw` to redeem those unbacked shares proportionally from the vault’s existing balance, stealing other users’ funds.
- Recommended fix:
  - Use OpenZeppelin `SafeERC20` for all token transfers and check results.
  - Apply Checks-Effects-Interactions: finalize state only after a successful token transfer.
```solidity
using SafeERC20 for IERC20;

// In deposit:
uint256 balanceBefore = depositToken.balanceOf(address(this));
depositToken.safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), amount);
uint256 received = depositToken.balanceOf(address(this)) - balanceBefore;
// compute shares using `received`, then update state
```

2) Fee-on-transfer/deflationary token share inflation
- What: `deposit` calculates `shares` using `amount` and a `vaultBalance` read before tokens are actually received. If the token takes a fee (deflationary/fee-on-transfer), the vault receives less than `amount`, but mints shares as if it received the full `amount`. This over-mints shares and lets a depositor withdraw more than the value contributed, stealing from others.
- Attack scenario:
  - Attacker deposits a fee-on-transfer token with 10% fee.
  - Vault receives only 90 but mints shares as if 100 were received (or computes using pre-transfer `vaultBalance`).
  - Attacker immediately withdraws proportional value, extracting the 10% shortfall from other depositors’ pool.
- Recommended fix:
  - Compute shares off the actual amount received by measuring the vault’s balance before and after the transfer.
  - Only update `userShares`/`totalShares` after the transfer succeeds and you know `received`.
```solidity
uint256 balanceBefore = depositToken.balanceOf(address(this));
depositToken.safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), amount);
uint256 received = depositToken.balanceOf(address(this)) - balanceBefore;

uint256 shares;
if (totalShares == 0) {
    shares = received;
} else {
    uint256 vaultBalance = balanceBefore; // balance before this deposit
    shares = (received * totalShares) / vaultBalance;
}
userShares[msg.sender] += shares;
totalShares += shares;
```

3) Reentrancy risk via external token calls
- What: The contract makes external calls to an untrusted token (`transferFrom`, `transfer`, `balanceOf`). While your `withdraw` updates state before `transfer`, `deposit` updates state before `transferFrom`. A malicious token could attempt reentrancy during those calls (e.g., ERC777-like behavior or a custom ERC20 that invokes callbacks). Combined with the share-mint-before-transfer bug, this increases blast radius.
- Attack scenario:
  - Attacker controls the token contract. During `deposit`, after shares are incremented and before funds arrive, `transferFrom` reenters and calls `emergencyWithdraw` for an attacker-controlled address that already holds shares. Even if not directly profitable in every path, reentrancy can be chained with other accounting edge cases to manipulate timing and pool ratios.
- Recommended fix:
  - Add a `nonReentrant` guard to `deposit`, `withdraw`, and `emergencyWithdraw`.
  - Apply strict CEI: compute, then external call, then state update (or vice versa, consistently ensuring reentrancy safety with guards). For `deposit`, prefer external transfer first, then compute shares, then update state.
```solidity
contract YieldVault is ReentrancyGuard {
    function deposit(uint256 amount) external nonReentrant { /* ... */ }
    function withdraw(uint256 shares) external nonReentrant { /* ... */ }
    function emergencyWithdraw() external nonReentrant { /* ... */ }
}
```

4) Reliance on untrusted `balanceOf` for economic decisions
- What: Share pricing and withdrawals depend on `depositToken.balanceOf(address(this))`. A malicious “ERC20” can lie about balances, skewing share issuance and redemption to drain the vault when combined with failed/partial transfers.
- Attack scenario:
  - Malicious token reports inflated `balanceOf`, causing newcomers to receive too few shares (diluting honest users) or causing over-redemption calculations.
- Recommended fix:
  - Allow only audited, known-safe ERC20s (immutable address set in constructor is good, but the token itself must be trusted).
  - Where possible, favor accounting by tracking internal balances and using deltas around transfers. Never trust a token that can lie about its balance. If you must support arbitrary tokens, add an allowlist and off-chain due diligence.

5) Reward compounding is a no-op but can be used to grief future logic
- What: `compoundRewards` calculates `rewards` but does not mint/add them to the vault; it only updates `lastRewardTime`. In a future iteration where rewards are actually added based on elapsed time, allowing anyone to call it can let an attacker repeatedly zero out accrual windows right before others act, causing timing griefing.
- Attack scenario:
  - If rewards later become real (minted or transferred), an attacker front-runs `withdraw`/`deposit` by calling `compoundRewards()` to reset `lastRewardTime`, reducing expected yield.
- Recommended fix:
  - Either implement real reward funding and correct accounting now, or remove this function until ready.
  - If kept, make accrual idempotent and independent of arbitrary calls, or restrict who can call it if rewards come from a trusted source.

Recommended Remediations (consolidated)
- Use OpenZeppelin `SafeERC20` and handle non-standard ERC20s correctly. Check return values.
- Compute deposits based on actual `received` amount (pre/post balance delta). Do not mint shares based on `amount`.
- Add `ReentrancyGuard` and mark user-facing functions as `nonReentrant`.
- Enforce CEI pattern consistently. For `deposit`: transfer first, compute `received`, compute shares, update state. For `withdraw`: compute amount, update state, then transfer (already done).
- Restrict tokens to audited ERC20s or maintain an allowlist. Avoid supporting fee-on-transfer or deceptive tokens unless you implement proper handling.
- Revisit rewards: either implement actual reward funding or remove/disable `compoundRewards` to avoid misleading users and future griefing.

Edge Cases and Second-Order Effects
- Small deposits and rounding: using deltas can produce zero `shares` for tiny deposits if `received` is very small; consider a minimum deposit or rounding strategy.
- Deflationary tokens on withdraw: sending to users could also incur fees; clarify that users receive “post-fee” amounts or avoid such tokens entirely.
- Direct donations: external transfers to the vault increase share price; this is acceptable but should be documented.
- Last user withdrawal: division/rounding can leave dust; consider sending remaining dust to the last withdrawer when `totalShares` approaches zero.

Minimal code sketch (illustrative)
```solidity
using SafeERC20 for IERC20;

function deposit(uint256 amount) external nonReentrant {
    require(amount > 0, "Amount must be positive");

    uint256 balanceBefore = depositToken.balanceOf(address(this));
    depositToken.safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), amount);
    uint256 received = depositToken.balanceOf(address(this)) - balanceBefore;
    require(received > 0, "No tokens received");

    uint256 shares = (totalShares == 0)
        ? received
        : (received * totalShares) / balanceBefore;

    userShares[msg.sender] += shares;
    totalShares += shares;
}

function withdraw(uint256 shares) external nonReentrant {
    require(userShares[msg.sender] >= shares, "Insufficient shares");

    uint256 vaultBalance = depositToken.balanceOf(address(this));
    uint256 withdrawAmount = (shares * vaultBalance) / totalShares;

    userShares[msg.sender] -= shares;
    totalShares -= shares;

    depositToken.safeTransfer(msg.sender, withdrawAmount);
}
```

Status: I finished the security review and outlined concrete exploit paths with practical fixes. 

- Replaced raw ERC20 calls with `SafeERC20` and delta-based accounting
- Added `nonReentrant` guards and CEI guidance
- Flagged fee-on-transfer tokens and deceptive `balanceOf`
- Clarified reward logic issues and edge cases
